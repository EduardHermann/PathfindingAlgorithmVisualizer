# PathfindingAlgorithmsVisualizer

## Description

- The program visualizes the following pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra
  - AStar/A*

## How to use the program

- Left mouse button: draw start node, then end node, then barrier
- Right mouse button: remove node
- D key: visualize Dijkstra
- A key: visualize AStar

## How to start the program
 
- Install the program via the "PVInstaller.exe" file
- Execute the Main.exe file in the folder which had been created by the installer
- !!!Attention, you need windows installed on your pc in order to correctly start my program!!!

## What I have learned from this project

- Python
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Pygame
